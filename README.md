# RAG Assistant Project
- This project is about understanding basics of RAG pipeline. 
- A Gradio interface is created which takes a PDF document as input and a QA bot answers questions regarding the document. 
- Two models were used for this project from IBM's Watsonx.ai: one for embedding the text chunks and creating vector database, and another for the QA bot.
- Created a web app in Azure.
